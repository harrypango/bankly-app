# Bankly Project

A simple static web app built for showcasing a Bank, with a very simple and minimalist, yet beautiful design. It uses different scrolling and navigating animations, which please the user and add to a user-friendly experience.

Note: some of the links or buttons are still not working, since this was mostly built to showcase different animations and functionalities like lazy loading the images etc.
